# ML Ops Project

This repository contains machine learning operations (MLOps) experiments and development work. The project uses MLflow for experiment tracking and model management, along with standard data science libraries for model development.

## Project Structure

- `Lab_1_development.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the main development work
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python packages:
- MLflow (v2.15.1) - For experiment tracking and model management
- NumPy (v1.26.4) - For numerical computations
- Pandas (v2.2.2) - For data manipulation and analysis
- scikit-learn (v1.5.1) - For machine learning algorithms

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebook to start working with the project:
```bash
jupyter notebook Lab_1_development.ipynb
```
